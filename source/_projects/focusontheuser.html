<p>Extension for Safari to replace Google+ Profiles in Google search results with the most relevant social profiles.</p>

<p>This Safari Extension is based on the bookmarklet by focusontheuser.org. It is just a wrapper for their code and the original developers receive all credit.</p>

<p>Both the original bookmarklet and my extension are no longer working.</p>
